# ZeekNote

Running **Zeek** (formerly Bro) on a phone or Windows system is not straightforward because Zeek is designed primarily as a network security monitoring tool for Linux/Unix-based systems. Here's how you can approach this on either platform:

---

### 1. **Zeek on Windows**

While Zeek is not natively supported on Windows, you can use one of these methods:

#### **Method 1: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**  
1. **Install WSL**:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```bash
     wsl --install
     ```
     This installs Ubuntu or your preferred Linux distribution.

2. **Install Zeek**:
   - Launch your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu).
   - Follow Zeek installation instructions for Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y zeek
     ```
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     zeek --version
     ```

3. **Capture Network Traffic**:
   - Install tools like `tcpdump` to provide traffic data for Zeek analysis.
   - Use Zeek on pcap files:
     ```bash
     zeek -r file.pcap
     ```

#### **Method 2: Use a Virtual Machine**  
1. Install a virtual machine tool like **VirtualBox** or **VMware**.
2. Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).
3. Follow the standard Zeek installation process for Linux.

### 2. **Zeek on a Phone**

Zeek is not natively supported on Android or iOS, but you can use the following approaches:

#### **Method 1: Use a Termux Environment (Android Only)**  
1. Install Termux from the Play Store or F-Droid.
2. Update and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pkg update
   pkg install root-repo
   pkg install zeek
   ```
   *(Note: Zeek might not work perfectly due to hardware/network limitations on phones.)*

#### **Method 2: Use Remote Access**  
Run Zeek on a remote server or system and access it via your phone:
1. Set up a Linux server running Zeek.
2. Use an SSH client (e.g., Termux or JuiceSSH) to connect to the server from your phone.
3. Analyze data remotely.

### Considerations
- **Resource Limitations**: Phones and Windows systems are not optimized for running high-performance network monitoring tools like Zeek.
- **Root/Administrator Access**: Zeek often requires elevated privileges to capture live network traffic.
- **Alternative Tools**: If running Zeek is not feasible, consider lightweight tools or cloud-based network monitoring solutions.
